State Saving System for Pure Data

RSVP is a state saving system for Pure Data (http://puredata.info/). It was created to offer Pure Data users a way to record presets for the GUI objects inside patches.

RSVP stands for two things Répondez S’il Vous Plaît and my initials Rafael Subía Valdez Presets. The concept of RSVP in an invitation is to confirm assistance to an event, so this translated to the preset system is that that space and time is reserved for a certain value, it is "reserved".

This version of RSVP is completely developed with Pure Data vanilla 0.50 which makesthe system more robust by dropping all third party dependencies.
